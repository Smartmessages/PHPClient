This contains client libraries and example code for the [smartmessages.net](http://info.smartmessages.net/) email management service's public API.

Currently we have libraries for PHP and .NET, but we'd welcome contributions for other languages.

Please feel free to suggest modifications, submit tickets and pull requests in [our github repo](https://github.com/Synchro/SmartmessagesClients) - these libraries are intended to make YOUR life easier!

Documentation for the API can be found in [our help wiki](http://wiki.smartmessages.net/#API)
